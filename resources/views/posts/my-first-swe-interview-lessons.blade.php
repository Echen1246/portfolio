                Lessons learned from my first software engineering interview experience at Neuralink. A reflection on the technical depth, behavioral preparation, and live coding challenges that define modern SWE interviews.
            </p>

        <article class="post-content">
            <p>It's been a while since my last post! The last few weeks have been a whirlwind of starting university again, building new projects, and diving headfirst into interview prep. I've gone through a few application cycles already, but I wanted to dedicate this post to my first true software engineering interview experience: a final-round panel at Neuralink. While I've had data science and more business-sided roles in the past, this was my first true SWE experience.</p>

            <p>After making it through multiple rounds, I unfortunately didn't get an offer. Of course, I was disappointed; getting an offer from a company where our values and goals aligned perfectly, on my first real attempt, would have been wild. The night before I got the email, I was literally dreaming about all the verbal and technical blunders I thought I'd made. Lo and behold, I woke up to the tough news.</p>

            <p>But after the initial disappointment, I realized what an incredible learning opportunity it was. I couldn't beat myself up over failing my first technical interview cycle. While I'm under a strict NDA about the specific questions and internal details, I wanted to share some of my key takeaways for anyone else going through this process, like the various cycles you should be prepared for.</p>

            <h2>The Behavioral</h2>
            
            <p>Every interview, no matter how technical, is about storytelling. The most effective way to answer behavioral questions ("Tell me about a time...") is the STAR method. Think of yourself as a book as well; you need a personal mission/passion.</p>
            
            <p>I'm a huge proponent of having personal projects (or hackathon) to show what you can build. I've had my fair share of dashboard/calorie tracker projects, but I think having a fullstack, serviceable, and company-related solution to a problem is best. For instance, mymelo.org (health) was referenced often during my behavioral, technical, and panel interviews.</p>
            
            <p>Extending on your resume: be prepared to know every in and out of your resume, from your projects, to gaps in timelines, career choices, how you got certain awards, etc. Of course, you should already know your projects' in's and out's, but visiting your project code to refresh your memory doesn't hurt.</p>
            
            <p>I think being sociable works to your advantage extremely well. Being able to make small talk, make the interviewer feel comfortable and like a 'long-lost friend' goes the distance. I believe my behavioral was my strongest stage for several reasons: I asked killer questions, made solid conversations, knew my resume very well and could tell compelling stories about my background. You should be prepared for standard questions like 'Why this company' or 'Tell me about yourself', but also edge cases like 'So why did you make this project?' Thus, it's important to have a personal mission, as well as know what you want. Be prepared to show your personal depth; I'm not too sure about F500 companies, but startups like Neuralink have personal qualities very high on their list of priorities (technical depth is also important, see more below).</p>

            <h2>Technical Depth</h2>
            
            <p>This was one of the hardest parts of my process. Not having done SWE interviews before, I had a hard time gauging how much depth was depth. Should I dive deep into the codebase and explain line-by-line? Or is it more structural-focused, and I need to know things like tradeoffs on every decision, costs, etc?</p>
            
            <p>I had to think about a few key aspects: Justify my tradeoffs, Understand how your tools work under the hood (like AWS, definitely explain things like data security, schema, structure, etc), and thinking about the future; how would this tool/service scale? What about maintenance, costs?</p>
            
            <p>Reddit is your best friend here; many panel interviews where you complete a technical question or present a personal story.</p>
            
            <p>Here's some sample questions I found online that I should have prepared for:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>What are your file formats? How were they determined/designed?</li>
                <li>How does your application interface with active directory?</li>
                <li>How is your application structured? What does it communicate with and what protocols does it use?</li>
                <li>How do you measure application health? How is that tied into your application deployment?</li>
                <li>If your API goes offline, is there another service being used as a back up?</li>
                <li>Why this tech stack?</li>
                <li>How do the components interact with each other?</li>
                <li>What happens if both API services go down? What sort of error messages will display? Is there an automated alert that gets sent to your team?</li>
                <li>What would you do differently going forward? Why?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Live Coding</h2>
            
            <p>To be clear, I aced the technical interview (the 2nd round). However, I do want to touch on some things I could have done to give my interviewer a better impression.</p>
            
            <p>Here's how I approached my question within an hour: I spent the first 5-10 minutes reading over the question carefully, taking notes. I asked my interviewer all sorts of questions to determine constraints, if certain features should be added, and generally just think out loud. What really helped with my initial nervousness was one of my friends telling me, "The interviewer is there to help you; think of it as a pair programming exercise, they want to see you succeed instead of embarrassing yourself."</p>
            
            <p>Bang out all the edge cases first, before moving on to completing basic requirements, before working on additional features. I made a mistake here by completing the basic question first, and creating more features to the question for 20 minutes; I completely forgot about rigorously testing edge cases in the beginning, a rookie mistake.</p>

            <h2>What's Next?</h2>
            
            <p>So, what's next? I have to admit, no matter how positive my mindset was, getting a 'no' was disappointing. But, overall, my mindset has changed greatly. It was one of the most intense and valuable experiences I've had engineering wise, and has given me a crystal-clear picture of the bar at the highest level. This whole process validated my efforts and my caliber of expertise. Now, it's time for me to take these lessons, sharpen my blade, and go even further.</p>
